Here are some examples of the use of my Qahirah
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/qahirah)) Python binding for the Cairo
graphics library. You will need to have that installed before you can
run these.

Mosto of these example scripts generate their output to a PNG
file with the same basename as the script. Thus, to run a script
*script* and see its output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/53606552/Qahirah-Examples).

The exceptions are `x11_colours_booklet`, `cairo_samples` and
`bulk_font_sample`; the first two generate a PDF file, while the
latter is a utility for generating sample renditions of a whole lot of
fonts at one go, as a PDF or PostScript file for easy viewing.
