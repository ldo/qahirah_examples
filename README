Here are some examples of the use of my Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah)) Python binding for the Cairo graphics library.
You will need to have that installed before you can run these.

With one exception, each example script generates its output to a PNG
file with the same basename as the script. Thus, to run a script
*script* and see its output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/53606552/Qahirah-Examples).

The exception is the `bulk_font_sample` script; this one is a utility
for generating sample renditions of a whole lot of fonts at one go,
as a PDF or PostScript file for easy viewing.
