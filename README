Here are some examples of the use of my Qahirah Python binding for
the Cairo graphics library. You will need to have that installed
before you can run these.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same
basename as the script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its
output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png
