Here are some examples of the use of my
[Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah) Python binding for the Cairo
graphics library. You will need to have that installed before you can
run these.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same
basename as the script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its
output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png
